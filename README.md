A work in progress Google Chrome extension that will allow me to find all videos on a page
and convert them to a video player of my making.

Basic planned features:

[ ] Finds and converts videos automatically

[ ] Allows for setting a start and stop point within the video

[ ] Allows looping between these two points

[ ] Allows saving video snippets taken from between the two points in various file formats

[ ] Allows for greater control over playback speed

[ ] Allows for greater control over volume (beyond 100%)
